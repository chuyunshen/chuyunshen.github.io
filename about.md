Hello, I'm <a href="https://translate.google.ca/?sl=zh-CN&tl=en&text=%E6%A5%9A%E9%9F%B5&op=translate" target="_blank">Chuyun</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'm a software developer based in Toronto, Canada. I moved here from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuyao" target="_blank">Yuyao</a>, China when I was sixteen. I completed two bachelors--Computer Science and Psychology, from the University of Toronto.
</p>
In my free time, I like tinkering with new technologies, reading, biking, doing ballet, painting, DIYing, and playing with my cat <a href="/momo" target="_blank">Momo</a>.

Please feel free to reach out through email.
