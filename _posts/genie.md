Genie, built on Python, sends your pre-drafted heartfelt birthday wishes to your Facebook friends.

This is a collaborative project with <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/nataliamoran">Natalia</a>.

Genie scrapes Facebookâ€™s birthday calendar information. For Facebook friends who have not disclosed their birthday information on Facebook, users are also able to manually enter a birthday.
