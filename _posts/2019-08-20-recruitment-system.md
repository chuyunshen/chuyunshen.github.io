Recruitment system was done as part of the software design course at school. The requirements were given to us resembling how projects are handled in the industry. I got to practice design patterns, Java, and team work with this project that I worked on almost every day for two months.

Source code can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/chuyunshen/recruitment-system">my GitHub</a>.

Below are a few UML digrams illustrasting the design for our system.
